Idea:
Website/Game for kids to teach them that their choices can affect the environment.
Have a child standing and giving her different options of what to do with daily activities.
Ex: have a soda can in her hand and have the option to either litter on the ground outside or put it in the recycling bin and based on that choice, there is an impact in the environment shown in the background. (:
